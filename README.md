# scheme48-mode
Emacs major mode for editing Scheme48 files.

[Scheme48](http://www.s48.org/) is an implementation of the programming language [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)). This mode is an extension to the normal SchemeMode and provides specific interactions with Scheme48. This means that expressions evaluated with C-x C-e etc. will be evaluated in the correct package (a module, in the Scheme48 world) automatically.

This mode is a successor to cmuscheme48.el which comes with Scheme48.
